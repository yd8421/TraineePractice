Data Structure Assignment: 
1. Implement STACK to perform the below operations using arrays.
a. push
b. pop
c. display
2. Implement QUEUE to perform the below operations using arrays.
a. enqueue
b. dequeue
c. display
3. Implement circular queue using arrays.
4. Implement Single Linked List
5. Implement Double Linked List.
6. Implement Circular Single Linked List
7. Implement Circular Double Linked List
8. Operation to be performed on SLL and DLL:
a. Insertion -
1. Insert at the beginning
2. Insert at the end
3. Insert at a given position
4. Insert before a given position
5. Insert after a given position
6. Insert before a given number
7. Insert after a given number
8. Insert at the middle
9. Insert at penultimate node.( The term "penultimate node" refers to the second-to-last node in a linked list. Example head -> Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 -> Node4 -> NULL  The penultimate node in this list is Node3 because it is the node right before the last node (Node 4)
b. Deletion -
The above operations 8.1-8.9 on SLL and DLL has to be implemented on Deletion
9. WAP to create a linked list of n nodes & copy the contents of the list to a file format_data.db. The number n and file name should be passed from command line.
10. Write a complimentary program to program 9 which will read the contents from the format_data.db, recreate linked list and print the content of the linked list on to stdout.
